A resource on the roses sold by Old City Cemetery in Lynchburg, VA at their
annual Rose Festival Sale. It will provide a detailed description, history,
and care instructions. Additionally, it will give indicators for it's color
and fragrance. The festival also sells rose companion plants, and the same information will
be provided for each of those as well.

Ideally, a QR code generation and scanning system will be added so that users
can scan the code with a mobile device and be navigated directly to the page
for that specific plant.
